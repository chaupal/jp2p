/**
 * The JXTA protocols often need to refer to peers, peer groups, pipes and other JXTA resources. These references are presented in
 * the protocols as JXTA IDs. JXTA IDs are a means for uniquely identifying specific peer groups, peers, pipes, codat and service
 * instances. JXTA IDs provide unambiguous references to the various JXTA entities. There are six types of JXTA entities which
 * have JXTA ID types defined: peergroups, peers, pipes, codats, module classes and module specifications. Additional JXTA ID
 * types may be defined in the future.
 * JXTA IDs are normally presented as URNs. URNs are a form of URI that ‘... are intended to serve as persistent, locationindependent,
 * resource identifiers’. Like other forms of URI, JXTA IDs are presented as text. See IETF RFC 2141 RFC2141 for
 * more information on URNs.
