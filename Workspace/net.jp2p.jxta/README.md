Chaupal extensions to JXSE under the Apache License, version 2.0

This package contains a specification of the JXTA 2.0 Protocols, and is aimed to separate the specification from the implementation. 
Currently the JXTA implementation is a monolith, and does not allow itself to be cleanly separated from the specification. 
Also, due to uncertainty regarding the SUN/Oracle license of the original code, it is difficult to continue development on this code.
The Chaupal JP2P Interface packages aims to resolve these problems
